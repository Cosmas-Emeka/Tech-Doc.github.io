                    <p id="indent">Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy 
                        emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Below is a simplified definition of

                            <li>It is  garbage-collected.</li>

                            Python was conceived in the late 1980s by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> at Centrum Wiskunde & 
                            Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. He created it as a successor to the ABC programming language, 
                            which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. 
                            Python was first released in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many 
                            major new features. Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported 
                            to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the <code>2to3</code> utility, which automates 
                            the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.

                            Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses 
                            English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly
                            brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer 
                            syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.

                        Python's large standard library provides tools suited to many tasks, and is commonly cited as one 
                        of its greatest strengths. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME
                        and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational
                        databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating
                        regular expressions, and unit testing. Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications—
                        for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333—but most are
                        specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard
                        library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant
                        implementations. As of June 2022, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party
                        Python software, contains over 380,000 packages with a wide range of functionality, including:

                        Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a read-eval-print loop (REPL), permitting them to 
                        function as a command line interpreter for which users enter statements sequentially and receive results 
                        immediately. Python also comes with an Integrated development environment (IDE) called IDLE, which is more 
                        beginner-oriented. Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved 
                        auto-completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting. As well as standard desktop integrated 
                        development environments, there are Web browser-based IDEs, including SageMath, for developing science- 
                        and math-related programs; PythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, 
                        a commercial IDE emphasizing scientific computing.
